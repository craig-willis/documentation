#How to access data

TERRA-REF data is stored in three locations: Clowder, BETYdb, and CoGe

**Clowder** contains data related to the field scanner operations and sensor box, including bounding box of each image / dataset as well as location of the sensor, data types and processing level, scanner missions.

**BETYdb** contains plot locations and other geolocations of interest (e.g. fields, rows, plants) that are associated with agronomic experimental design / meta-data (what was planted where, field boundaries, treatments, etc).

**CoGe** contains genomic data.
