 #Scientific objectives / experimental design

 ### Maricopa Agricultural Center, Arizona

Three hundred thirty one [*lines were planted in 2016*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nfabx_n1rNlO6NW3olD8MAibJ3KHnOMmMwOYYw4wwGc/pubhtml?gid=239932660&single=true&widget=true&headers=false). Plantings occurred both under and west of the gantry system. Access the [*experiments planned for 2016*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nfabx_n1rNlO6NW3olD8MAibJ3KHnOMmMwOYYw4wwGc/pubhtml?gid=890543376&single=true&widget=true&headers=false). Access the field layouts [*under the gantry*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nfabx_n1rNlO6NW3olD8MAibJ3KHnOMmMwOYYw4wwGc/pubhtml?gid=1231399646&single=true&widget=true&headers=false) and [*west of the gantry*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nfabx_n1rNlO6NW3olD8MAibJ3KHnOMmMwOYYw4wwGc/pubhtml?gid=728631369&single=true&widget=true&headers=false) in 2016.

The [*Lemnatec Scanalyzer Field Gantry System*](http://www.lemnatec.com/products/hardware-solutions/scanalyzer-field/) is the largest field crop analytics robot in the world. This high-throughput phenotyping field-scanning robot has a 30-ton steel gantry that autonomously moves along two 200-meter steel rails while continuously imaging the crops growing below it with a diverse array of [*cameras and sensors*](http://terraref.org/articles/lemnatec-scanalyzer-field-sensors/).

Twelve sensors are attached to the gantry system. Detailed information for each sensor including name, variable measured, and field of view are [*available here*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nfabx_n1rNlO6NW3olD8MAibJ3KHnOMmMwOYYw4wwGc/pubhtml?gid=1886254108&single=true&widget=true&headers=false). The planned sensor missions and their objectives for 2016 are [*available here*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nfabx_n1rNlO6NW3olD8MAibJ3KHnOMmMwOYYw4wwGc/pubhtml?gid=2092320800&single=true&widget=true&headers=false).

### Automated controlled-environment phenotyping, Missouri

Experimental design, lines

The Scanalyzer 3D platform consists of multiple digital imaging chambers connected to the Conviron growth house by a conveyor belt system, resulting in a continuous imaging loop. Plants are imaged from the top and/or multiple sides, followed by digital construction of images for analysis.

- RGB imaging allows visualization and quantification of plant color and structural morphology, such as leaf area, stem diameter and plant height.

- NIR imaging enables visualization of water distribution in plants in the near infrared spectrum of 900–1700 nm.

- Fluorescent imaging uses red light excitation to visualize chlorophyll fluorescence between 680 – 900 nm. The system is equipped with a dark adaptation tunnel preceding the fluorescent imaging chamber, allowing the analysis of photosystem II efficiency.

The LemnaTec software suite is used to program and control the Scanalyzer platform, analyze the digital images and mine resulting data. Data and images are saved and stored on a secure server for further review or reanalysis.
