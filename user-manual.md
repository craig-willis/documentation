# User Manual

## Introduction

The ARPA-E TERRA program aims to stimulate technical advances in high-throughput phenotyping of energy crops. A central component of the program is the creation of a core reference dataset, TERRA-REF, to facilitate the development of new analytical methods. The TERRA-REF dataset includes:

* Raw output from sensors deployed on Lemnatec field and greenhouse systems, UAVs and tractors
* Manually-collected fieldbooks along with protocols
* Derived data, including phenomics data, from a variety of computational approaches
* Genomic pipeline data


The TERRA-REF reference dataset may be of interest to a variety of research communities including:

* Computer vision\/remote sensing\/image analysis \(raw sensor data and metadata\)
* Physiologists \(plants and how they are growing\)
* Robotics \(gantry\/location\/orientation\)
* Breeders \(derived traits\)
* Genomics\/bioinformaticians \(genomics data\)

Our objectives are to ensure that the software and data in the reference data and computing pipeline are _interoperable, reusable, extensible, and understandable_ by providing clear definitions of data formats.

## How to use this data
