# User Manual

The ARPA-E TERRA program aims to stimulate technical advances in high-throughput phenotyping of energy crops in the field.

The TERRA-REF [core reference dataset](/data-products.md) includes:

* Raw output from sensors deployed on Lemnatec field and greenhouse systems
* Genomic data
* Fieldbooks and protocols
* Derived data using a variety of computational processes

A central goal in providing this core reference dataset is to facilitate the development of new analytical methods. The TERRA-REF data set may be of interest to a variety of research communities including:

* Computer vision\/remote sensing\/image analysis \(raw sensor data and metadata\)
* Physiologists \(plant and how it's growing\)
* Robotics \(gantry\/location\/orientation\)
* Breeders \(derived traits\)
* Genomics\/bioinformaticians \(genomics data\)

Our objectives are to ensure that the software and data in the reference data and computing pipeline are _interoperable, reusable, extensible, and understandable_. Providing clear definitions of common formats will make it easier to analyze and exchange data and results.

This user manual is divided into the following sections:

* Data Products: Summary of available data products
* [Scientific objectives and experimental design](/scientific-objectives-and-experimental-design.md)
* [Data use policy](/data_release_policy.md)
