# User Manual

## Introduction

The ARPA-E TERRA program aims to stimulate technical advances in high-throughput phenotyping of energy crops in the field. A central part of the program is providing a core reference dataset to facilitate the development of new analytical methods. The TERRA-REF dataset includes:

* Raw output from sensors deployed on Lemnatec field and greenhouse systems
* Fieldbooks and protocols
* Genomic data
* Derived data using a variety of computational processes, including phenomics data.

The TERRA-REF data set may be of interest to a variety of research communities including:

* Computer vision\/remote sensing\/image analysis \(raw sensor data and metadata\)
* Physiologists \(plant and how it's growing\)
* Robotics \(gantry\/location\/orientation\)
* Breeders \(derived traits\)
* Genomics\/bioinformaticians \(genomics data\)

Our objectives are to ensure that the software and data in the reference data and computing pipeline are _interoperable, reusable, extensible, and understandable_. Providing clear definitions of common formats will make it easier to analyze and exchange data and results.
